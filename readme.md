## HorizonXI How to Start

This list is unordered because I don't know exactly what to do in the beginning

[Controller Setup](HorizonXI_Controller_Setup.md)


# Technical things
* If using a controller turn on hat thingy when configuring controller
* Change chat menu to horizontal...or maybe it's vertical?
* Change the sizing of chat windows in order to fit everything
* Turn off Yell
* Turn on UI addon
* Use click + shift to move addon

# Gameplay
* Open the second main menu, go to config, go to gameplay, under Inventory turn Sort to ON
* Talk to starting person near you for some quick info as to what things do
* Trade the adventurer coupon to them for 50 gil...which isn't that much D:
* Do the starting quest in order to unlock a ring that will give you 100% exp boost for 2 hours, the cooldown for this seems to be 12 hours which is stupid...
* One of the guards near the gate will be able to cast Signet, which is a buff that will give you the ability to gain crystals
* Equip your starting weapon: open the main menu, the large menu, go to equipment, then click on main then click on your weapon
* When you click on a monster, go to the bottom of the menu that just opened and click "Check", this will reveal the difficulty of the monster
* Not worthwile means it will not yield XP
* Do not fight anything that is a decent challenge, and if you must do it with a group, or do it with caution
* At level 5 go to the vendor in the city and pick up the level 5 version of your main weapon, you will now deal signicantly more damage
	* In Bastok, the desert city, there's vendors also in the back of shops
* Stats are very important, that being said eating is very important
* Follow the first quest, it requires reading, but it will make one of the items free and that item will give you double XP for 2 hours and then it has I believe a 12 hour cooldown and you can use it 2 more times.


# Gameplay - Auction House
* You must go to the residential district to get your gil from items you sold on the auction house
* The game does not tell you an exact price of an item on the auction house, instead it tells you the last paid item. The price of said item may or may not be higher or lower, this is simply a history of what sold


# Gameplay - Gardening
* You need a pot to plant things in and then possibly a crystal? I used https://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?fitem=816 to figure out what I'm gonna grow
* Doing this based off my experience and a guide, your mileage may vary
	1. Go to your residential area
	2. Click on your moogle
	3. Click on storage, then mog safe
	4. The inventory on the right is what you'll navigate through and find the items you have, such as seeds, flowerpots, and/or crystals, click on these items to transfer them to your mog safe
	5. Go back a menu, click layout, click layout again, click mog safe, click your flowerpot
	6. A grid will appear (it should appear), and your item will appear centerish on the screen, pick a location for it and then press the accept button
	7. Go back a menu, click gardening, click mog safe, click flowerpot, click plant seeds, click mog safe, click your specific seed you want, it will then ask you "Sow seeds?" press yes
	8. Back out of all the menus, leave your residence, go adventure or log off
	9. After some time (not sure how much) there will be a plant in your pot
	10. *Click on your moogle, click gardening, click mog safe, click flowerpot, click examine (THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IT WILL MAKE YOUR PLANT HAPPY)
		* By examining the plant you're effectively watering and pruning the plant
	11. (As of 7/21/23 I have not gotten here) When your plant emits a glow it will be time for harvest (It should tell you. Harvested items go directly into your mog safe)
